# react-untracked-astro (Archived)

## This repository has been archived

react-untracked-astro was a React app to assist with untracked astrophotography using DSLR and mirrorless cameras. 

However, development has shifted to a new project:

### [astro-shoots](https://github.com/imigueldiaz/astro-shoots)

astro-shoots is now the active repository for this application. It is rebuilt as a lightweight Python Flask app, which is easier to develop and maintain.

The react-untracked-astro repository is archived for reference but will no longer be updated. Please use [astro-shoots](https://github.com/imigueldiaz/astro-shoots) for the latest version.
